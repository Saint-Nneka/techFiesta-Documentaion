### Reward Assurance with On-chain and Off-chain Launch
A key consideration before a client's techFiesta is approved is their credibility to fund the solution they are receiving.

This is enabled by the On-Chain launch option which offers only stable tokens for payment. The payment of bounties to the winners is automated with a smart contract once the techFiesta is ended. 
However, if the client prefers to payout in their native token, they can use the Off-chain launch option and pay the USD equivalence of the bounty in their native token once the techFiesta ends. Both ways, `volatility is hedged and payment is processed fast` so that the participant can get the full worth of their reward immediately after the techFiesta ends. Also, the client gets the benefit of increasing their token utility.
